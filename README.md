labels within
images or camera stream.

in the app

  stream without saving the camera results
- **BarCode Types**: Barcodes are recognized over types and have a specialized UI to convey the
  information over to the user at ease

  local images taken previously

## 🔚 Conclusion

The project was started as a Google Lens clone. However, I did struggle a bit with the Ui. However,
the
end product has most of the feature common to the actual apps and yes, it's on device ml, so it is
not
always able to recognize certain barcode or labels.
